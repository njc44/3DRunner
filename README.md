# 3DRunner

This is a basic freerunner game played in First Person Perspective and inspired by the revolutionary 90's Wolfenstein 3D engine. 
Right now in this rudimentary version, you can navigate around a maze and try avoiding obsticles.

Ik it's cute, but I might add some bad guys and give myself a gun later and make it an OG 90's style game that's great to kill time!
